The team, the children, the mentors and guides, we are all a family now. It doesn't feel like we are working for anyone else, It's like we are working for ourselves.

            Pehchaan Ek Safar, a non-profit organization initiated and managed by students of IIT Ropar, stands dedicated to eradicating illiteracy and championing the Right to Education for children from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. In a landscape where access to education is a privilege and quality education remains elusive for underprivileged children, we recognize the urgency to counteract the widening societal gap exacerbated by the commodification of education. Pehchaan Ek Safar strives to fill this void by offering free, quality education in a nurturing environment. Through a mission of empowerment, we aim to equip these children with the tools and knowledge necessary to create a better, brighter, and happier future for themselves, ensuring they are not at a disadvantage compared to their more privileged counterparts.
